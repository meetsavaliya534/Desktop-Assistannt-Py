This Software aims at developing a personal assistant for Windows 
systems. The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the 
user at certain commands, provided in either of the ways, speech or text. 
It will ease most of the work of the user as a complete task can be done 
on a single command. This project draws its inspiration from Virtual 
assistants like Cortana for Windows and Siri for iOS. Users can interact 
with the assistant either through voice commands.
